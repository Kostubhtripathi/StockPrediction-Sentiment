# StockPrediction-Sentiment

This project predicts stock market movements based on social media sentiment analysis using machine learning.

---

## Features
- Scrapes social media data from platforms like Twitter or Reddit.
- Preprocesses and cleans text data, including sentiment analysis.
- Trains machine learning models to predict stock price movements.
- Evaluates model performance with various metrics and visualizations.

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebooks
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```python
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Execute the following notebooks in order:
   - **`1_scraping.ipynb`**: Scrape or load social media data.
   - **`2_preprocessing.ipynb`**: Preprocess the data and perform feature engineering.
   - **`3_model_training.ipynb`**: Train the machine learning model.
   - **`4_evaluation.ipynb`**: Evaluate the model's performance and analyze results.

---

## Data
- **Input Data**: Store your raw scraped data in the `data/raw_data/` folder.
- **Output Data**: Save preprocessed and analyzed data for training models.

---

## Results
- The evaluation notebook provides:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
  - Visualization of results (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
